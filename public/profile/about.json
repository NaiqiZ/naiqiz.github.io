  "about": "Hi all! My name is Naiqi. I’m an aspiring data scientist currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at MIT Sloan and Operations Research Center. I earned my bachelor's degree from Cornell University, where I studied Statistics - with a focus on mathematics and biostatistics - and English literature. My professional interests lie at the intersection of data science, product, and healthcare. I love people around me and want to make the world a better place. My current way of approaching this is by translating data into actions that support human health, equity, and well-being.\n\nFeel free to explore my past projects and don’t hesitate to reach out!\n\nOutside of data science, I find joy in movement — I’m a competitive ballroom dancer (still refining my jive kicks!) and an active member of the MIT Women’s Volleyball Club. In the winter, you’ll likely find me in a cozy ski town, chasing powder days.",
